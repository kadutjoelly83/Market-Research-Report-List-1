<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microturbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unrecuperated Microturbines</li><li>Recuperated Microturbines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The microturbine market consists of two primary types: unrecuperated and recuperated microturbines. Unrecuperated microturbines operate without a heat recovery system, making them simpler and less costly but less efficient at converting thermal energy into power. In contrast, recuperated microturbines incorporate a heat exchanger to recover waste heat, enhancing their overall efficiency and energy output. These systems are increasingly favored for distributed energy generation and combined heat and power applications, catering to various commercial and industrial needs.</p></p>
