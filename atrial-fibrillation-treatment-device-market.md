<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Treatment Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Atrial Fibrillation treatment device market includes two primary types: catheter ablation and Maze surgery. Catheter ablation involves using catheters to deliver energy, often radiofrequency or cryotherapy, to destroy abnormal heart tissue responsible for irregular rhythms. This minimally invasive procedure helps restore normal heart function. Maze surgery, on the other hand, is a more invasive technique where a surgeon creates a series of precise incisions in the heart's atria, forming scar tissue that disrupts pathways for erratic electrical signals. Both methods aim to improve patient outcomes by controlling or eliminating atrial fibrillation.</p></p>
